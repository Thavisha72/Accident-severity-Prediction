 Problem Statement 
Traffic accidents continue to be a major threat to public safety with loss of lives, injuries, and 
disruption to the economy. Knowledge of those underlying factors that may affect the severity of 
accidents will graciously play a role in granting authorities the ability to take proactive and effective 
safety measures. 
The present study attempts to study the application of machine learning with an emphasis on 
predicting severity in terms of Low, Moderate, or High according to driver behavior and 
Environmental factors. The end result should be a data-driven model that will go a long way in 
achieving considerable road safety and assist traffic management systems to incorporate such 
information in their decision-making processes. 
 Problem Description 
Traffic accidents can generally get more or less severe with driver behaviors such as Alcohol level 
of the driver , Driver experience and age of the driver sand environmental factors, such as weather 
conditions , road conditions , road type, road light conditions and traffic density. Conventional 
safety measures have relied on historical accident reports and expert judgments, while machine 
learning presents an approach that is more accurate and scalable. 
Key research questions are as follows. 
     ● How do environmental factors impact accident severity?  
     ● How do driver behaviours impact accident severity? 
     ● Moreover, is it even possible, given the historic data, to train a machine-learning model 
       that gives some sensible predictions of accident severity?  
     ● Which machine learning model serves with maximum accuracy in the classification of severity?  
This study applies some different machine-learning algorithms to predict the severity of an 
accident, assesses the algorithms' performance, and tries to arrive at an optimal model for predicting 
accident severity.
